# Introduction to Phylogenetics using DNA data

## Reconstructing evolutionary history due to common ancestry

Phylogenetics is the study of relationships among the species on the tree of life, a task made possible under the assumption that all current life on earth shares a common ancestor. Other than understanding the evolutionary history of species, in general, phylogenies have multiple specific applications including: understanding the history of populations through time, epidemiology, cancer biology, as well as the evolution of language.
